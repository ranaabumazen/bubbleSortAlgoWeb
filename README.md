 ## :beginner: About

I implemented the bubble sorting algorithm in my JavaScript code and used it to sort a randomly generated array of integers. 
The "randomize" button should be used to generate a new random array of the specified length, and the "solve" button should trigger the bubble sorting algorithm and display the sorting process visually on the web page.
